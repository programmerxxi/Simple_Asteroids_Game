Simple_Asteroids_Game
=====================

A simple asteroids game that i built but didn't complete yet


The File :Asteroids_BG.jar: is a simple background witch i hope to turn into a screen saver soon,
And the file :Asteroids_Beta_1.jar: is a beta astriods game that doesn't have a splitting rock function, or levelup functon, I disabled collison to allow for 40 rocks/asteroids to run and be destroyed.

To run simply double-click the .jar of your choosing and it'll run, if however it doesn't that means either a error has occured or the computer your running doesn't support java 7





  Enjoy

ps:

w/^ = foward

a/< = rotate counter clockwise

d/> = rotate clockwise

s/down = slow down the ship slowly

space/enter = Fire torpedo
